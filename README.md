# SpellingBeeSolver
This program generates solutions to NYT style spelling bee problems.

The initial version of this program is being written in Python because, why not?
The initial version will likely print to console, and lack GUI and other UI/UX/UE enhancing properties.
The initial version will likely require manual input of center and periphery letters. 

Later version may have a more refined appearance, and attempt to pull data about letter usage from the NYT site directly.
